EPOSS - Educational programming and observation support structure
-----------------------------------------------------------------

With EPOSS, students and lecturers are supported in programming physical
'things' in different education settings - offline, hybrid or online.
The EPOSS architecture allows for explicitly programming movement
commands or autoprogramming (injecting) replayed movements into moving
'things' and observing the effects.

Although conceptually generic, the EPOSS implementation is currently
focused on
 (i) EV3 robots as 'things'
 (ii) education in traffic engineering with appropriate scenarios
 (iii) Linux as educator operating system; students can use any system

How to start:
 - read the CSEDU'21 paper to get all background information
 - look at the architecture diagram
 - prepare environment by following instructions in rpycloudsetup.txt
 - boot up a 'thing' and make it accessible on the network
 - optional: add a corresponding hostname to /etc/hosts
 - adjust the hostname/address in localstart.sh and run the script
 - try out the manoevres after substituting rpyc with rpycloud
